Welcome to my respository for my advanced Statistics modeling projects! Starting from the fundamentals of vectors, matrices, and matrix differentiation, leading up to advanced topics like nonlinear regression and nonparametric regression.


- **Diagnostics and Business Applications:** Checking assumptions of linear models and applying them to business problems such as designing and pricing new products.
- **Confidence Intervals:** Bootstrap Regression and Monte Carlo Simulation for confidence interval estimation.
- **Principal Components Regression (PCR):** Handling situations with more variables than the sample size and visualizing competition in business.
- **Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net Regression:** Dealing with situations with more variables than the sample size and identifying key attributes influencing consumer preferences.
- **Moderation and Mediation:** Estimating models capturing moderation and mediation effects in regression.
- **Nonlinear Regression:** Estimation, inference, prediction, and interpretation of nonlinear models.
- **Guest Lecture and Nonparametric Regression:** Industry speaker presentation followed by a study of nonparametric regression methods.
